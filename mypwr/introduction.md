# Introduction

MyPower is an application to tokenize physical assets and their data with focus on the energy domain. The system enables two main use cases: One is the citizen participation use case, where members can become beneficiaries by investing into energy sources. The second is visualizing the origin of the energy that is consumed by the members by calculating the energy flows between the energy sources and consumption units in the system.
