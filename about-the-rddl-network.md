# About the RDDL Network

In an era characterized by interconnected systems and a burgeoning Web3 landscape, how do we ensure that the data we rely on is genuine, integral, and has its origins well accounted for?&#x20;

Enter the **RDDL Network**, designed to bridge this very gap.

***

## **Overview**

The **RDDL Network** is best described as the 'physical trust stack for Web3'. It stands as a testament to fostering unwavering trust in machine-generated data. But how does it achieve this?

***

## **Key Features & Processes:**

1. **Machine Attestation:** Owners can vouch for and tether their machines to the RDDL Network, setting the stage for a series of transparent, verifiable activities.
2. **Notarization:** Once connected, these machines go on to notarize various activities, highlighting their productivity. This not only bolsters transparency but also lends credibility to the data they generate.
3. **Proof of Productivity (PoP):** A distinguishing trait of the RDDL Network is its PoP challenge process. This innovative approach corroborates the notarized claims of devices. It doesn't just stop there; it also verifies data availability and implicitly establishes its provenance and integrity.
4. **Token Rewards:** For those contributing to maintaining and upholding this network of trust, there's a tangible reward. Participants are incentivized with RDDL tokens, granted upon successful participation in the PoP process.
5. **Bridging Economic Actors:** The network goes beyond mere data verification. It facilitates economic actors, allowing them to tap into dependable data sources that vouch for their own authenticity and that of their data.
6. **Economic Participation:** The real magic happens when these machines, now reliable nodes of data, get to play in the market. The RDDL Network's vision is to let machines barter their trusted data in exchange for RDDL Purpose Tokens.

Developers, as we dive deeper into a world steered by data, the RDDL Network stands out as a lighthouse, ensuring the data we navigate by is pure and unadulterated. Let's be a part of this transformative journey, ensuring a Web3 era marked by trust and transparency.
